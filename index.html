                <p>Hi, my name is Mitchel Busnel. This website you're looking at was coded entirely by me, from scratch, using Visual Studio Code(No thanks to UNH, of course). As time goes on, this website will become more fleshed out with projects and experiments I have developed. For now, I don't much to add, but I'll try to include some past items that are worth mentioning.</p>
